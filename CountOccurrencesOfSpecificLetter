/*
I've defined one main function and two helper functions.
-----
CountOccurrencesOfSpecificLetter: a function to count the occurrences of the specific letter and return a numerical value.
I have assumed: lists only include words with lowercase alphabetical characters, list can be of any length, list rather than an array.
If new array is empty, returns "There are no occurrences of this specific letter."
Examples
["hello", "are", "you", "there"], "r" -> 2
["the", "cat", "sat", "on", "the", "mat"], "a" -> 5
[] -> 0
-----
ExtractSpecificLetter: extracts all occurrences of the letter and puts into a new array
Examples
["h","e","l","l",o","a","r","e","y","o","u","t","h","e","r","e"], "r" -> ["r","r"]
["t","h","e","c","a","t","s","a","t","o","n","t","h","e","m","a","t"], "a" -> ["a","a","a","a","a"]
-----
LengthOfArray: returns the length of the array, which is therefore the count of occurrences.
Examples
["r","r"] -> 2
["a","a","a","a","a"] -> 5
